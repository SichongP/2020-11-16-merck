  The setup instructions for the Data Carpentry Ecology workshops (with Python)
  can be found at <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-python-workshop.html">
    the workshop overview site</a>. However, for this workshop, you will not need any software
   for the OpenRefine, Python, and SQL material other than an up-to-date web browser. You will be
  connecting to cloud instances through <a href="https://mybinder.org">MyBinder.org</a> built from
  <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/scaffolds/">Carpentries Scaffolds</a>. Links to these
  scaffold instances will be provided during the workshop. For the spreadsheets lesson, we assume you have
  Microsoft Excel (or equivalent) installed.
